# Airline Flight System

This application will be able to find the shortest flights between a graph of airports. This app would be used by airports and pilots to optimize their flight times. Each node would be an airport in a different city or state, and each edge would be the distance between airports, factoring in constraints such as weather conditions, delays, etc.

## How to use

### 1) Navigate to AFSFrontendFD.java within IDE

### 2) Run the file

### 3) Load a .dot file for airport graph

You can use "src/airportdata.dot" for an example file

Select [L] command, and enter: src/airportdata.dot

### Try the app

Test out all of the commands
